# CS50
This is a clinical quality measure notificationt tool created as a capstone project for the CS50 course. This tool allows you
to generate standard templates for different disease notifications then send a message to a user to ensure follow-up is completed
at the right time by the right person. 

This tool can accept a JSON or FHIR data feed as its source for notification details.
